This project is a replication of infinite monkey theorem; where when a monkey is given enough time to press random characters on a keyboard,
the monkey will eventually produce something of worth. 
This uses Java Fx to create a userInterface, allowing users to Type the string they want to search,
which then proceeds to run through different characters randomly
